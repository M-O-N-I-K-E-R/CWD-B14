            <blockquote>“Excellence is not being the best. It is doing your best.”</blockquote>
            <br>
            <p> Get up, show up, and never give up. The best remedy to regret is doing everything you
                can do on a constant basis, without ever trying to compare your life to other’s.
                When you engage in that kind of foolishness, you’ll end up feeling bitter, because,
                by out natural tendencies, we’ll never make such comparisons fair and equal.
                Take advantage of your limitless potential by setting out specific and
                ambitious goals and go out there smashing them. </p>

            <br>
            <blockquote>“Life is a journey, not a destination.”</blockquote>
            <br>
            <p> Are you still convinced that happiness will come to you someday?
                Unfortunately, someday is not a day at all, and if you keep postponing your eagerness and
                determination to live a better life, personal fulfillment will forever stay a dream.
                Enjoy every step you take, every decision you make and every small thing that
                gets you closer to appreciate life. There’s a reason if “enjoy the process” is one of the
                most cliché sayings of all times. </p>

            <br>
            <blockquote>“Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.”</blockquote>
            <br>
            <p> How many times did we try to fit ourselves into some predetermined path in life, just because someone
                else steered us that way?
                Growing up we were told we could have been everything we wanted to. What happened then? At some point,
                the script kicks in.
                All of a sudden we stop fantasizing about what might happen and start thinking about how to please our
                parents.
                Good grades. University. Degrees. Job. Safety. Sometimes what we need to do is just stop going through
                the motions and
                start pursuing more satisfying routes instead. A degree won’t make you a better or smarter person, just
                like a normal
                and safe job won’t make you an honest and hard-working individual. Start looking for what makes you
                tick, and do more of it,
                looking no further than the intrinsic satisfaction you get every time you engage in it. Shine in your
                own way. </p>
