        <h5> In Valorant, "agents" are the playable characters or characters you can select to play as during a
            match.
            Each agent has a unique set of abilities, including a signature ability, two basic abilities,
            and an ultimate ability. Agents are categorized into different roles:
            Duelists, Initiators, Controllers, and Sentinels, each with its own playstyle and abilities.
        </h5>

        <h4 class="padding-left red-text text-lighten-1">
            Here's a brief overview of the roles:
        </h4>

        <h5>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                Duelists: Duelists are aggressive agents focused on fragging and getting eliminations.
                They typically have abilities that help them engage enemies or secure kills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Initiators: Initiators are agents who can disrupt and control the battlefield.
                They excel at opening up new angles of attack, blinding or stunning enemies,
                and providing information to their team.
                <br>
                <br>
                Controllers: Controllers are agents that specialize in area control.
                They can create barriers, smokescreens, and other effects to control the map and limit enemy
                movement.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sentinels: Sentinels are defensive agents who can lock down areas and provide utility for their
                team.
                They often have abilities that protect teammates, gather information, or slow down opponents.
                <br>
                <br>
            </div>
            Valorant continually introduces new agents, and existing agents may receive balance changes
            over time to ensure gameplay diversity and fairness. The game's evolving meta and agent
            roster make for dynamic gameplay and strategy.
