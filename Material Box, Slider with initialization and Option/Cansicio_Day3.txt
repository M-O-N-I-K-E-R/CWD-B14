        "East Blue Saga"
    </h4>
    <h7>
        <p> The East Blue Saga[1] (“東の海”イースト･ブルー編, "Īsuto Burū" Hen?) is the first saga in the "One
            Piece" series and sets the stage for the larger adventure that follows. It encompasses several arcs, each
            with its own unique plot, but they are all interconnected as they introduce the core members of the Straw
            Hat Pirates and the challenges they face.
            <br>

        <div style="margin-left: 3%;">

            Romance Dawn Arc: This arc introduces us to Monkey D. Luffy, who gains the power of the Gomu Gomu no Mi,
            allowing his body to stretch like rubber. Luffy's dream is to become the Pirate King, and he sets off on a
            journey, assembling his initial crew members, including Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. The plot
            revolves around their initial encounters with various foes, including Captain Alvida and Buggy the Clown.
            <br><br>
            Orange Town Arc: The Straw Hat Pirates arrive at Orange Town, where they confront Buggy the Clown and his
            crew. Luffy's determination and fearlessness shine as he takes on Buggy's formidable abilities. The crew's
            adventure in Orange Town also introduces Usopp, a talented sniper and storyteller, and deepens the mystery
            surrounding the Grand Line.
            <br><br>
            Syrup Village Arc: In this arc, the crew encounters Usopp's hometown, Syrup Village, which is under threat
            from the pirate Kuro. The plot focuses on the crew's efforts to protect the village and defeat Kuro,
            showcasing the crew's growing bonds and strength.
            <br><br>
            Baratie Arc: The Straw Hat Pirates reach the floating restaurant known as Baratie, where they encounter the
            powerful pirate Don Krieg. Luffy and Sanji play key roles in this arc as they battle Don Krieg and his crew.
            This arc also explores Sanji's backstory and his decision to join Luffy's crew.
            <br><br>
            Arlong Park Arc: The crew travels to Nami's hometown, Cocoyasi Village, and confronts the tyrannical
            fish-man pirate Arlong. The plot centers on Nami's past and her struggle to free her village from Arlong's
            oppression. The crew's determination to help Nami and defeat Arlong marks a significant turning point in the
            saga.
            <br><br>
            Loguetown Arc: The saga concludes in Loguetown, where the crew encounters various challenges and glimpses of
            their individual dreams. Luffy revisits the execution platform where Gol D. Roger, the former Pirate King,
            was executed. The arc also features the introduction of Smoker, a powerful Marine Captain, and sets the
            stage for the crew's entry into the Grand Line.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        Overall, the East Blue Saga establishes the central characters, their motivations, and their initial
        adventures, laying the foundation for the epic journey that will take them to the ends of the world in
        search of One Piece.

        "Alabasta Saga"
    </h4>
    <h7>
        <p> The Alabasta Saga is the second saga in the "One Piece" series and consists of several arcs that are
            interconnected as they follow the Straw Hat Pirates' journey towards the Alabasta Kingdom. Here's a summary
            of each of these arcs:
            <br>

        <div style="margin-left: 3%;">

            Reverse Mountain Arc: This arc sees the crew entering the dangerous Grand Line through Reverse Mountain.
            They face the whale Laboon and his caretaker, Crocus, and make a promise to return after exploring the Grand
            Line.
            <br><br>
            Whisky Peak Arc: The crew arrives at Whisky Peak, seemingly a hospitable island with a celebration in their
            honor. However, it turns out to be a trap set by the Baroque Works organization. The crew engages in battles
            against the Baroque Works agents, exposing the organization's presence.
            <br><br>
            Little Garden Arc: The Straw Hat Pirates arrive on Little Garden, an island filled with prehistoric
            creatures. Here, they meet two giants, Brogy and Dorry, who have been locked in a duel for a hundred years.
            The crew gets embroiled in their conflict and faces more Baroque Works agents.
            <br><br>
            Drum Island Arc: The crew arrives at Drum Island, which is ruled by the tyrannical Wapol. They meet Tony
            Tony Chopper, a reindeer with a Human-Human Fruit ability, and help him save his home. This arc also marks
            the beginning of the crew's quest to find a doctor.
            <br><br>
            Alabasta Arc: The central and most significant arc of this saga. The crew finally reaches Alabasta, a
            kingdom in crisis due to a rebellion led by Baroque Works and the mysterious Mr. 0. The crew's mission is to
            help Princess Vivi stop the rebellion and save her kingdom. They face numerous Baroque Works agents,
            including Crocodile (Mr. 0), and uncover the organization's sinister plans.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        The Alabasta Saga is notable for its themes of rebellion, loyalty, and the crew's growing reputation in the
        world. It also marks a turning point in the series as the crew confronts powerful adversaries and gets entangled
        in a deeper conspiracy involving the ancient weapons known as the Poneglyphs.
